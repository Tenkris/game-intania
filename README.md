# Realms of Math

A turn-based RPG math learning game where players solve math problems to defeat monsters and progress through increasingly challenging levels.

## üéÆ Game Overview

> Realms of Math combines classic RPG elements with educational math challenges. Players embark on a journey through various levels, battling monsters by correctly answering math questions. Each correct answer allows the player to attack, while wrong answers give the monster a chance to strike back.

## üéØ Core Game Mechanics

Question-Based Combat
The combat system is question-driven, where:

1. Player is presented with a math question
2. Correct answers trigger the Critical Hit mini-game
3. Success in the mini-game determines attack damage multiplier
4. Damage is calculated and applied to the monster

### Defense System

During monster attacks, players engage in an active defense system:

1. Player rapidly presses the spacebar to charge a shield
2. Shield strength determines damage reduction
3. The defense effectiveness is determined by player reaction time and input speed
